    <h>Welcome to our blog! We are three wiiiiiild kitties!</h>
    <img src="Cats.jpg" A photo of our cats.">

    <p>We are three kitties who live with our parents in Seattle, WA. We love
    to wrestle and beg for food. Our humans love us very much and we take
    advantage of that fact!</p>

    <p class="best">My name is Marzipan and I'm the boss! I gave birth to these
    crazy kitties and now they're bigger than I am! Isis is the solemn brawler
    and she's older than Jamie Lee by about a minute. Jamie Lee Curtis is a
    squeak toy with a pink belly. I am a fluffy white kitty with pretty blue
    eyes, but I admit that sometimes I do look a little crazy. I don't like it
    when my humans talk to me while they pet me. I prefer peace and quiet but
    rarely do I get it!</p>

    <p class="isis">My name is Isis and I am a pretty kitty with grey colorpointed
    fur and rings around my tail. I have blue eyes like my mama and sometimes I
    like to howl at night and especially when I don't get any attention. I have
    found that the bathtub is the ideal howling spot as it amplifies my voice!
    I love to eat and dream about that one bird that got away.</p>

    <p class="JLC">My name is Jamie Lee Curtis and I am too cute for words! I
    don't know how to meow so sometimes I do a silent meow. I can't stop
    licking my belly-it's an issue. I really love the bed and headbutting the
    two humans. Sometimes I like it so much I drool. My humans say that I am
    the worst fighter out of all of us, but I am trying to get better. I
    love boxes!</p>
